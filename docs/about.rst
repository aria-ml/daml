Data Analytics
--------------

The scope of data analytics is very broad, but as DAML is developed, we look for impactful metrics such as the ones below as a guide towards feature development.

**Model-agnostic metrics that bound real-world performance**

* relevance/completeness/coverage
* metafeatures (data complexity)

----------

**Model-specific metrics that guide model selection and training**

* dataset sufficiency
* data/model complexity mismatch

----------

**Metrics for post-deployment monitoring of data with bounds on model performance to guide retraining**

* dataset-shift metrics
* model performance bounds under covariate shift
* guidance on sampling to assess model error and model retraining
