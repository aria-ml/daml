# Data-Analysis Metrics Library (DAML)

## About DAML

The Data-Analysis Metrics Library, or DAML, focuses on characterizing image data and its impact on model performance across classification and object-detection tasks.

**Model-agnostic metrics that bound real-world performance**
- relevance/completeness/coverage
- metafeatures (data complexity)

**Model-specific metrics that guide model selection and training**
- dataset sufficiency
- data/model complexity mismatch

**Metrics for post-deployment monitoring of data with bounds on model performance to guide retraining**
- dataset-shift metrics
- model performance bounds under covariate shift
- guidance on sampling to assess model error and model retraining

## Getting Started
For the quickest way to get started using DAML in your workflow, additional information is in our Sphinx documentation hosted in [here](https://jatic.pages.jatic.net/aria/daml/) on Gitlab Pages.
